# To Change

Modifications I would make teaching this class the next time.

- Use "Now You See It" by Stephen Few instead of Tufte for design text.
- Less on walking through markdown
- talk earlier on about goal - mapping data to aesthetic properties. Principles of design as description of aesthetic goals that can be manipulated.
